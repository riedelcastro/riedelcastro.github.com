I'm currently a Researcher at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/). I am also a Professor at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk) as a proud member of the [UCL NLP](http://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) lab, and an [Allen Distinguished Investigator](http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/programs/investigators-fellows/key-initiative/adi-artificial-intelligence-awards). I used to be a researcher at [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research/), a postdoc and research scientist with [Andrew McCallum](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) at [UMass Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu), a researcher at [Tokyo University](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) and [DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/en/) with [Tsujii Junichi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun'ichi_Tsujii), and a PhD student with [Ewan Klein](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ewan/) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home).

I work on [teaching machines how to read, reason and write](http://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
